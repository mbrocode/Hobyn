As a class, we develop a web app that connects local hobbyists. A "Hobby" could be anything from getting people together for a run or pick up basketball game to playing a tabletop game or getting together to practice yoga, etc.

I cannibalized a previous web app I built, implemented google maps, and got an API key to work with Google and it seems to be working correctly. Here is a screenshot of the working map portion and rendering of where I'm kinda going with this idea (took base template from Trulia.com):

Because I do not believe it will take very long with a whole class working on this, I would like to implement Android and iOS versions of the collectively built web version. We can break up into teams (people can choose if they want experience working with Andriod or iOS dev), divide the required tasks/features and go through a mini Agile cycle of sprint planning, sprints, tests and release to finish at an agreed-upon date. 

I think it would be nice for everyone to present a short presentation on their contribution. Similar in length to this presentation, and share what you have done, so that everyone gets the experience of how the different portions of the apps work.

### Code:
We will primarily be using HTML, CSS, and javascript for the web app. The database will primarily be SQL and maybe some PHP to connect everything. 

If we decided to expand into Andriod and/or IOS we will be using those perspective languages aswell (mostly java for Android and/or Objective-C or Swift for iOS, I have no experience building iOS apps).
